small twitter clone
currently not working because i dont have enough prisma space ðŸ˜­

however i did learn that prisma kind of sucks (no foreign key support, although i hear that they are adding it)
also next/typescript for back is a bit rough although do-able

would b fun to re-write this in GO (but still with react hehe)
